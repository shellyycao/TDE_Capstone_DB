"""Charge category taxonomy — single source of truth for this pipeline.

Imported by glue_jobs/charge_type.py via Glue's --extra-py-files job
parameter, so the taxonomy only ever lives in one place. If you change a
category here, only charge_type.py needs to be re-run afterward (then
build_charge_categorized.py + dashboard.py to propagate it downstream).

Patterns are lowercase regex fragments matched against `Charge Type` and
`Charge Description` combined into one string (see normalize/rule_classify_row)
-- not tried separately field-by-field. An earlier version tried `Charge Type`
to completion first and fell back to `Charge Description` only if nothing
matched; that badly undercounted subcategories like "Ground", because a
generic `Charge Type` value like "Freight" would match a catch-all pattern
before ever looking at `Charge Description`, where the real detail (e.g.
"Ground Commercial") actually lives.

Within each major, order matters: more specific subcategories are listed before
generic ones (e.g. "Chargeback Fuel Surcharge" before the generic fuel pattern;
"Ground" before the generic "Transportation / Base Charge" fallback).

# Charge", "Terminal Charges", ...), character n-gram TF-IDF scored many of them similar
